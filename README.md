# portfolio-generator

This is a Node.js application that creates a personal portfolio for you, based on prompts from the command line that you'll fill out.  So, simply clone onto your computer, and create your portfolio!

The header will include your name and Github profile, and an "About Me" section if you so choose.  Then, you'll have the option to add projects, descriptions, and links to the project if you so choose.  You can feauture certain projects as well.  The style sheet included will make it look polished. 

Please enjoy and thanks for checking out my Github site!
